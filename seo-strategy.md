# MazTechDesigns — 90-Day SEO Execution Plan
**Goal:** Zero to consistent daily impressions and clicks within 90 days.
**Last updated:** February 2026

---

## PHASE 1 AUDIT FINDINGS

### Root cause of zero impressions:
1. **Single indexable URL** — all content was on index.html. Google has nothing to crawl.
2. **Thin content per topic** — 2–3 sentences per service. Not enough for topical authority.
3. **No dedicated service pages** — Google cannot rank a page for "Shopify web design" when that phrase appears once on a general page.
4. **No location pages** — zero local SEO signal for London searches.
5. **Sitemap had 5 URLs**, 3 of which were legal pages with 0 search value.

### Phase 1 actions completed:
- [x] Created `/services/web-design.html` (1,400+ words, FAQ schema)
- [x] Created `/services/shopify-development.html` (1,400+ words, FAQ schema)
- [x] Created `/services/ecommerce.html` (1,200+ words, FAQ schema)
- [x] Created `/services/branding.html` (1,100+ words)
- [x] Created `/locations/web-designer-london.html` (1,300+ words, LocalBusiness schema)
- [x] Updated sitemap.xml from 5 URLs to 10 URLs
- [x] All new pages have: FAQ schema, Service schema, breadcrumbs, internal links, CTAs

### Immediate actions required (do these today):
1. **Submit sitemap in Google Search Console:** Go to GSC → Sitemaps → Add `https://maztechdesigns.co.uk/sitemap.xml`
2. **Request indexing for each new page** via GSC URL Inspection tool (do this for all 5 new pages)
3. **Verify Google Business Profile** is set up at `business.google.com` with correct NAP
4. **Set up Google Search Console** if not already done at `search.google.com/search-console`

## PHASE 5 — INTERNAL LINKING & TOPIC CLUSTER STRUCTURE

### Core topic cluster:
```
Homepage (index.html)
├── /services/web-design (hub for web design content)
│   ├── /blog/[web-design-posts]
│   ├── /locations/web-designer-london
│   ├── /locations/web-designer-manchester
│   └── /industries/web-design-restaurants
│
├── /services/shopify-development (hub for Shopify content)
│   ├── /blog/[shopify-posts]
│   ├── /industries/shopify-ethnic-fashion
│   └── /industries/shopify-streetwear
│
├── /services/ecommerce (hub for e-commerce content)
│   ├── /blog/[ecommerce-posts]
│   └── /industries/ecommerce-food-drink
│
└── /services/branding (hub for branding content)
    └── /blog/[branding-posts]
```

### Internal link rules:
1. **Every service page** must link to at least 2 other service pages
2. **Every blog post** must link to 1 service page (the most relevant one)
3. **Every location page** must link to all 4 service pages
4. **Every industry page** must link to its relevant service page
5. **Homepage** must link to all 4 service pages in the Services section (update the service card links)
6. **Maximum link depth:** any page must be reachable in 3 clicks from homepage

### Update index.html service cards — add links:
Change each service card `<article>` to link to its service page:
- Web Design card → `/services/web-design`
- Branding card → `/services/branding`
- E-Commerce card → `/services/ecommerce`
- UX/UI card → `/services/web-design`
- Custom Themes card → `/services/shopify-development`
- Performance card → (future: `/services/performance-optimisation`)

### Anchor text rules:
- Use exact-match anchor text on the first link only on each page
- Use partial-match and synonym anchors for subsequent links on the same page
- Never use "click here" or "read more" as anchor text
- Good examples: "Shopify web design for UK brands", "web designer in London", "e-commerce website design"

## CRITICAL SUCCESS METRICS TO TRACK IN GSC

Check Google Search Console weekly for:
1. **Total Impressions** — are they growing week on week?
2. **Total Clicks** — are clicks growing?
3. **Average CTR** — below 2% means your titles need work
4. **Average Position** — positions 11–20 are "page 2 trap" — these pages need freshening
5. **Top Queries** — what are people actually searching to find you?
6. **Top Pages by Impressions** — which pages are getting seen?
7. **Index Coverage** — are all your pages indexed?

### 90-day targets (realistic, based on low starting point):
- **Day 30:** 500+ impressions/week, 5–10 clicks/week
- **Day 60:** 2,000+ impressions/week, 30–60 clicks/week
- **Day 90:** 5,000+ impressions/week, 100–200 clicks/week, 2–3 organic enquiries
