      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="legal__updated">Last updated: 11 February 2025</p>

      <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the MazTechDesigns website at <a href="https://maztechdesigns.co.uk">maztechdesigns.co.uk</a> (the "Site") and any web design, branding, development, or related services (the "Services") provided by MazTechDesigns ("we", "us", or "our"), a web design agency operating in the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>By accessing the Site or engaging our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Site or our Services.</p>

      <h2>1. About Us</h2>
      <p>MazTechDesigns is a UK-based web design and digital agency providing website design, branding, e-commerce development, UX/UI design, custom themes, and performance optimisation services to clients worldwide.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Email: <a href="mailto:hello@MazTechDesigns.co.uk">hello@MazTechDesigns.co.uk</a></li>
        <li>Location: United Kingdom</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Use of the Website</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Permitted Use</h3>
      <p>You may use the Site for lawful purposes only. You agree not to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the Site in any way that breaches any applicable local, national, or international law or regulation.</li>
        <li>Reproduce, duplicate, copy, or resell any part of the Site without our express written permission.</li>
        <li>Attempt to gain unauthorised access to the Site, the server on which it is stored, or any connected systems.</li>
        <li>Introduce viruses, malware, or other malicious code to the Site.</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>2.2 Accuracy of Information</h3>
      <p>We make reasonable efforts to ensure the information on the Site is accurate and up to date. However, we do not guarantee that all content is complete, accurate, or current, and it should not be relied upon as such.</p>

      <h2>3. Services and Engagement</h2>

      <h3>3.1 Enquiries and Proposals</h3>
      <p>Submitting a contact form or enquiry does not constitute a binding agreement. A contract for Services is only formed when both parties agree to a written proposal, scope of work, or service agreement.</p>

      <h3>3.2 Project Scope</h3>
      <p>All projects are governed by a separate project agreement or proposal that outlines:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Scope of work and deliverables</li>
        <li>Timeline and milestones</li>
        <li>Pricing and payment terms</li>
        <li>Revision and approval process</li>
        <li>Cancellation and refund terms</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the event of any conflict between these Terms and a project agreement, the project agreement shall take precedence for that specific engagement.</p>

      <h3>3.3 Client Responsibilities</h3>
      <p>When engaging our Services, you agree to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide accurate and complete information, content, and assets as required.</li>
        <li>Review and provide feedback on deliverables within the agreed timescales.</li>
        <li>Ensure you have the rights to any content, images, or materials you provide to us.</li>
        <li>Make payments in accordance with the agreed payment schedule.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.4 Payment Terms</h3>
      <p>Unless otherwise specified in a project agreement:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A deposit is required before work commences (typically 50% of the total project fee).</li>
        <li>The remaining balance is due upon project completion and before final files or website access is transferred.</li>
        <li>All invoices are due within 14 days of issue unless otherwise agreed.</li>
        <li>Prices are quoted in GBP (£) unless stated otherwise. VAT will be added where applicable.</li>
        <li>Late payments may incur interest at 8% above the Bank of England base rate, in accordance with the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.5 Revisions</h3>
      <p>Each project includes a defined number of revision rounds as specified in the project agreement. Additional revisions beyond the agreed scope may be subject to additional charges, which will be communicated and agreed upon before the work is carried out.</p>

      <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>

      <h3>4.1 Our Content</h3>
      <p>All content on the Site — including but not limited to text, graphics, logos, icons, images, design elements, code, and layout — is owned by MazTechDesigns or our licensors and is protected by UK and international copyright, trademark, and intellectual property laws.

      <h2>7. Cancellation and Termination</h2>

      <h3>7.1 Project Cancellation by Client</h3>
      <p>If you wish to cancel a project after work has commenced:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The deposit is non-refundable.</li>
        <li>You will be invoiced for any additional work completed beyond the deposit amount.</li>
        <li>Any deliverables or files completed up to the point of cancellation will be provided upon full payment of outstanding fees.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7.2 Termination by Us</h3>
      <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate a project if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Payment obligations are not met after reasonable notice.</li>
        <li>You provide content or instructions that are unlawful, defamatory, or infringe third-party rights.</li>
        <li>Continued engagement becomes impracticable due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>12. Severability</h2>
      <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.</p>
